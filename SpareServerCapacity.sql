-- Microsoft Azure's capacity planning team wants to understand how much data its customers are using, and how much spare capacity is left in each of it's data centers. Youâ€™re given three tables: customers, datacenters, and forecasted_demand.
-- Write a query to find the total monthly unused server capacity for each data center. Output the data center id in ascending order and the total spare capacity.

SELECT d.datacenter_id, sum(f.monthly_demand) as demand

INNER JOIN datacenters as d ON d.datacenter_id = f.datacenter_id
INNER JOIN customers c ON c.customer_id = f.customer_id
